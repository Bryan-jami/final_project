# Project final
Requirements
In this project, you are asked to build a web application of your own. The nature of the application is up to you, subject to a few requirements:

Your web application must utilize at least two of Python, JavaScript, and SQL.
Your web application must be mobile-responsive.
In README.md, include a short writeup describing your project, what’s contained in each file you created or modified, and (optionally) any other additional information the staff should know about your project.
If you’ve added any Python packages that need to be installed in order to run your web application, be sure to add them to requirements.txt!
